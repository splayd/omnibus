## Learning Software Development

### [Mozilla: Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
Welcome to the MDN Learning Area. This set of articles aims to provide complete
beginners to web development with all they need to start coding simple websites.

## Software Design

### [Sandi Metz: Get a Whiff of This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU)
Most code is a mess. Most new requirements change existing code. Ergo, much our
work involves altering imperfect code.

That's the bad news.

The good news is that every big mess consists of many small ones. Certain small
problems occur so frequently that they've been given names, and are
collectively known as "Code Smells".

This talk shows how to take a pile of perplexing code, identify the "smells",
and surgically apply the curative refactorings. It breaks a messy problem into
clear-cut pieces, and proves that you can fix anything without being forced to
understand everything.

### [Sam Jones: JavaScript Is Too Convenient](https://vimeo.com/267418198)
Which conveniences do we take advantage of everyday? Which are taking advantage
of us?

Objects and functions sure are convenient, so convenient that we do many
shortsighted things just because they’re easy.

In-line objects and anonymous functions create a poor signal to noise ratio,
making it hard to understand your code.

Learn ways to give confusing things names, focus on what’s important, and write
nicer code.

## Testing

### [Justin Searls: Please don't mock me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af4M8GMoxi4)
Confusion over test doubles starts with what to even call them. You might know
them as stubs, proxies, mocks, or spies (but I call them test doubles, because a
book you've probably never read declared it to be the most general term). I've
spent a decade fascinated by the disconnect between why test double libraries
were invented and how they are actually used by teams. What I've learned: their
purpose fills a little-known but valuable niche, whereas their appeal addresses
a mainstream but self-destructive impulse. If you don't leave this talk with a
clearer distinction between tests that ensure safe changes versus tests that
promote simple designs, I'll give you your 45 minutes back. Once that groundwork
is laid, you'll better understand the characteristics that matter most in a test
double library and the nuanced rules that should govern their use. I've found
this clarity invaluable for producing valuable tests and maintainable code, and
I think you will too.
