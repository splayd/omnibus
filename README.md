### [Sandi Metz: Get a Whiff of This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU)
Most code is a mess. Most new requirements change existing code. Ergo, much our
work involves altering imperfect code.

That's the bad news.

The good news is that every big mess consists of many small ones. Certain small
problems occur so frequently that they've been given names, and are
collectively known as "Code Smells".

This talk shows how to take a pile of perplexing code, identify the "smells",
and surgically apply the curative refactorings. It breaks a messy problem into
clear-cut pieces, and proves that you can fix anything without being forced to
understand everything.

### [Sam Jones: JavaScript Is Too Convenient](https://vimeo.com/267418198)
Which conveniences do we take advantage of everyday? Which are taking advantage
of us?

Objects and functions sure are convenient, so convenient that we do many
shortsighted things just because they’re easy.

In-line objects and anonymous functions create a poor signal to noise ratio,
making it hard to understand your code.

Learn ways to give confusing things names, focus on what’s important, and write
nicer code.
