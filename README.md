Most code is a mess. Most new requirements change existing code. Ergo, much our
work involves altering imperfect code.

That's the bad news.

The good news is that every big mess consists of many small ones. Certain small
problems occur so frequently that they've been given names, and are
collectively known as "Code Smells".

This talk shows how to take a pile of perplexing code, identify the "smells",
and surgically apply the curative refactorings. It breaks a messy problem into
clear-cut pieces, and proves that you can fix anything without being forced to
understand everything.
